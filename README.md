# Multi-domain Powertrain Model of Electric Light Aircraft
Multi-domain modeling of general aviation electric light aircraft powertrain.

## Pipistrel Velis Electro

This project is generally focused on developing multi-physics (electrical, thermal, vibration) models of a light electric airplane. As a general goal, the team has chosen the Pipistrel Velis Electro as the target aircraft. However, the models developed here are not based on any real components within the Pipistrel Velis Electro, no information from Pipistrel was provided for this project, and the team does not have any involvement with Pipistrel or its suppliers.

## Multiphysics Model

This project is developing multiphysics models to enable the development of next-generation control methodologies and energy storage systems with increased safety for general light aviation.

## Testbed

The team has developed a power electronics testbed at USC to enable the cost-effective co-design of power electronics and energy storage systems. This testbed is approximately scaled to match the Pipistrel Velis Electro.
